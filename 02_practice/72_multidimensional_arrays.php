<p>Not only can you store integers and strings in arrays, you can also store... other arrays! This is called a multidimensional array.</p>

<p>How do we do this? Well, just like a normal array with comma-separated values, but you would put comma-separated arrays insteadâ€”just like the code in the editor.</p>

<p>$deck is an array which contains 3 rows, each being a playing card. Within each row, it has the name of the card, along with the value.</p>

<p>To retrieve a card, we would first get the row for that card, then get the value we require (either to display the card, or calculate the player's total).</p>

<p>If we access $deck[2], we would get the third row (remember, arrays start from 0 in PHP!)</p>

<p>That will return another array containing 2 values: the first (0) which is a string that has the value "7 of Diamonds", and the second (1) which is an integer that has the value 7.</p>

<p>If we want the "7 of Diamonds" string, we would simply use $deck[2][0];.</p>

<p>Try adding another card to the array. It can have whatever rank, suit, and value you like, but keep in mind the value should be a number!</p>

      array_push($deck, array('Ace of Spades', 1));
